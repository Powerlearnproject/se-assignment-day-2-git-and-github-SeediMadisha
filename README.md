## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
(VCS) Version control is a system that helps you monitor changes to code, documents, or other digital content over a period of time. It allows you to view changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of them.
Key Concepts:
1. Repository (Repo): Where all the files, history, and metadata are stored.
2. Commit: A snapshot of the changes made to the codebase, along with a description of the changes.
3. Branch: A separate line of development in the repository, allowing multiple versions of the codebase to coexist.
4. Merge: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another.

GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code because it:
1. Provides a cloud-based repository: GitHub hosts your repository in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere.
2. Offers collaboration facilities: GitHub enables multiple developers to work on a single project, using tools like pull requests, issues, and project management.
3. Allows version control: GitHub uses Git, a well-known version control system, to keep track of changes to the codebase.
4. Provides massive community: GitHub has a large developer community, which can be useful while looking for help, resources, and feedback.

Version control helps maintain projet integrity by:
1. Tracking change: Version control keeps a tab on all codebase changes and allows you to understand who has made what modifications, when they were made, and why.
2. Conflicts prevention: With branches and merging changes, version control prevents conflicts between numerous versions of the codebase.
3. Supports rollbacks: If there is some mistake, you can roll back to a previous version of the codebase so that the mistake has a lesser impact.
4. Supports collaboration: Version control facilitates multiple developers to work on a single project and save it simultaneously, reducing the possibility of any mistake or inconsistency.
5. Provides a backup: Version control provides you with a backup of your codebase, and in the worst scenario of a disaster, your work remains safe.
